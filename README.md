                                                            Introduction

   In today's competitive retail landscape, understanding customer behavior and sales patterns is crucial for driving growth and improving customer satisfaction. This analysis leverages MySQL for extracting and analyzing sales data and Power BI for visualizing insights. We will explore key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide recommendations for future growth.

                                          Data Collection and Preparation

 Extracting Data with MySQL

We begin by extracting sales data from the supermarket's database using MySQL. The tables of interest include `customers`, `orders`, `orderdetails`, and `products`. Key columns include:

ordernumber`
orderdate`
status`
productcode`
quantityordered`
priceeach`
customername`
`city`
`country`

                                               Data Analysis
              Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We'll calculate several KPIs to understand customer sales performance:

1. Total Sales: Sum of `quantityordered * price_each`.
2. Average Order Value (AOV): `Total_Sales / Total_Orders`.
3. Sales by Customer: Total_sales per customer.
4. Sales by Product Category: Grouping_sales by `productline`.
5. Geographical Sales Distribution: Sales by city and country.
6. Customer Retention Rate: Percentage of repeat customers.
